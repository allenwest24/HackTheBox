Used the inspect element to see the html code
Found a script with source labeled /js/inviteapi.min.js
Went to that address
Found a function "makeInviteCode"
Back to login screen
Console Tab in Chrome Developer Tools
Type makeInviteCode()
Grabbed the encoded message and decoded it.
Told me to go to /api/invite/generate
In terminal, curl -XPOST https://www.hackthebox.eu/api/invite/generate
Got an encoded invite code
Decoded
Entered
