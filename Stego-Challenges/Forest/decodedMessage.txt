The forest is a complex ecosystem consisting mainly of trees that buffer the earth and support a myriad of life forms. 
The trees help create a special environment which, in turn, affects the kinds of animals and plants that can exist in 
the forest. Trees are an important component of the environment. They clean the air, cool it on hot days, conserve heat 
at night, and act as excellent sound absorbers. HTB{************}
