What can nslookup be used for?

There are different scenarios in which the use of nslookup is appropriate. In this way, the command-line program is an especially 
crucial tool when resolving DNS issues. First and foremost, a data query helps find the cause of the problem at hand. For example, 
those who use Windows and experience an issue with the active directory can use nslookup to quickly and easily check whether all 
involved servers are converted in the domain name system as planned. Generally, this program shows its strengths when various 
subdomains are involved â€“ not only when it is simply a matter of checking them, but also when there are connection problems.

To install on Linux:

sudo apt install dnsutils
